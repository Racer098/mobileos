                    <p>Let’s start with the most popular, open source, operating system, Android. Android is difficult to analyze because vendors have the ability to modify the OS, or ROM, to their liking, causing a lot of variance between different devices. OnePlus, the Chinese budget phone manufacturer uses their own version of Android called OxygenOS, which in October of 2017 was found to be collecting data about user’s activities, tying the data to their serial number, which can then be tied to the individual who purchased the device. On the other hand, GrapheneOS is built from the ground up to be an extremely secure and private version of Android. These two ROMS took Android’s openness in two entirely different directions.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">IOS - Apple</h2>
                    <p><br>Let’s move over to iOS. Apple’s security is very strong, mostly because of their heavy app requirements from the App Store and general locked-down nature of the OS.<br><br>As for security, projects like GrapheneOS are arguably better than iOS as well. The coolest thing is these ROMs are generally FOSS, offering another awesome benefit over iOS, increasing user trust and transparency. As a side note, avoid rooting and jailbreaking devices, since it’ll open up your device to malicious activities. There are scenarios where rooting and jailbreaking can be beneficial for us, but most of you should avoid it unless you know exactly what you’re doing.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/privacy_profile_image%20(1).png" width="450">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>As for other mobile operating systems Windows phones are for the most part dead, and we know their privacy and security doesn’t stack up. Librem 5 and the pinephone are the most notable projects, and they rely on Linux. Linux phone are currently a huge dropoff in user security, but they still have yet to be fully released so let’s wait for that to happen first.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
